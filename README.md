# JAX-ext

Miscellaneous extensions for JAX that might be too niche to upstream.

Note: This is just a dumping ground for utilities I find myself re-using, so the API is
subject to change and I make no guarantees about the stability of the code!


## Installation

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/adrn/jax-ext
```
